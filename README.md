## ðŸ“– Who Mediates in a Digital Platform?

The growing use of digital platforms for reading raises questions about who fulfills the role of reading mediator. Educators and booksellers have traditionally provided the scaffolding for reading. In the digital space, however, this figure becomes blurred and indistinct.

`EcoPoetico` is a tool focused on the recommendation of poems. Through the use of Natural Language Processing, each poem allows for a journey toward others that are most similar in semantic content.

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/melanchthon19/ecopoetico.git

```

## Using Your Own Corpus

Follow the instructions in `ecopoetico/process_corpus/` in order to create recommendations using your own corpus.

The expected structure of your folder `corpus` inside `process_corpus` is:
```
.corpus/
â”œâ”€â”€ author-1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ title-poem-1.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ title-poem-2.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ author-2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ title-poem-1.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ title-poem-2.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ author-3/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ title-poem-1.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ title-poem-2.txt
```

Remember to adjust the model for feature extraction in the `main` function of the file `ecopoetico/process_corpus/extract_features.py`.
