## 📖 Who Mediates in a Digital Platform?

The growing use of digital platforms for reading raises questions about who fulfills the role of reading mediator. Educators and booksellers have traditionally provided the scaffolding for reading. In the digital space, however, this figure becomes blurred and indistinct.

EcoPoetico is a tool focused on the recommendation of poems. Through the use of Natural Language Processing, each poem allows for a journey toward others that are most similar in semantic content.
